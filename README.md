The replication.R script generates all regressions for both the main analysis and the appendix, along with all figures included in the main document.

main_data.rds is the main dataset for most regressions and some of the figures.

Figures 1-3 are produced using ivs_sub.dta

interstate.rds is equivalent to main_data.rds, except that it exclusively uses UCDP interstate conflicts as the basis for constructing the main independent variables (e.g., y10moving_comb500, y10moving, etc.)
It is used to produce Table V in the appendix
